# Self Assessment Day
A solo project for Epicodus **06.16.18**

## By Bobby Martin

## Self-Assessment
1. Is there anything about the general job search and internship interview process you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in your job search and internship interviews?
  * The technical part of the interview is definitely something I feel slightly unprepared for. Attempting more white-boarding/algorithmic challenges would make me feel more prepared in this scenario. Also brushing up on terminology out-loud would make me feel a little more confident as well.


2. Is there anything about searching for and transitioning into your future career a technical field that you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in this process?
  * I've always heard that using a template for cover letters might steer you the wrong way. I think my current cover letter knowledge could use some improvement, so that I can feel comfortable submitting it do potential job openings.

## Plan
  * Spend time working on coding challenges
  * Spend more time crafting a clear and concise cover letter
  * Practice terminology out-loud with my partner at home.
  * Improve my portfolio website, maybe build it into a basic React App

## Work
  * (8:30am) - Craft cover-letter
  * (10:38am) - Editing cover-letter
  * (10:58am) - Submitted cover-letter to Epicenter
  * (11:00am) - Start FreeCodeCamp challenges
  * (1:04pm) - Completing Challenges
  * (3:01pm) - [Watched this video about interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6lwJ6Rixnc)
  * (3:13pm) - [Another Junior Dev interview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX0ajFKB2E0)
  * (3:42pm) - [First week as a junior dev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4LohbB1yUs)
  * (4:00pm) - Working on more algorithm challenges

## Reflection & Next Steps
I feel like I've learned that I haven't had much experience manipulating arrays of objects. I definitely need to focus more on that. As well as learning about HTTP terminology and how that functions. My imposter syndrome starts to hit a little hard when I keep going through these coding challenges. I guess I just wish I had a little better of an understanding of whats going to be expected of me.

I don't feel like I've made a lot of forward progress today. I tend to get stuck on one problem for quite a while, and hack my way through it. My next steps are going to be reading more documentation on object manipulation. Especially when comparing key value pairs. I guess I just need to feel more comfortable with JavaScript principles, and more advanced JS topics as well. I know about higher order functions, but using them still proves difficult, and I can't seem to gauge how much of that I need to know at a junior level.
