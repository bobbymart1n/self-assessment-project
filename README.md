# Self Assessment Day
A solo project for Epicodus **06.16.18**

## By Bobby Martin

## Self-Assessment
1. Is there anything about the general job search and internship interview process you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in your job search and internship interviews?
  * The technical part of the interview is definitely something I feel slightly unprepared for. Attempting more white-boarding/algorithmic challenges would make me feel more prepared in this scenario. Also brushing up on terminology out-loud would make me feel a little more confident as well.


2. Is there anything about searching for and transitioning into your future career a technical field that you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in this process?
  * I've always heard that using a template for cover letters might steer you the wrong way. I think my current cover letter knowledge could use some improvement, so that I can feel comfortable submitting it do potential job openings.

## Plan
  * Spend time working on coding challenges
  * Spend more time crafting a clear and concise cover letter
  * Practice terminology out-loud with my partner at home.
  * Improve my portfolio website, maybe build it into a basic React App
